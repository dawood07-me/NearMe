    <p>Egypt, a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and the Sinai Peninsula 
        in Asia, is renowned for its ancient civilization, which flourished along the banks of the Nile 
        River. It is home to some of the world's most iconic landmarks, including the Pyramids of Giza, 
        the Great Sphinx, and the temples of Luxor. With a rich cultural heritage that has influenced 
        Europe, Africa, and Asia, modern Egypt is a blend of ancient traditions and contemporary 
        influences. Its economy is a developing mixed economy, with tourism, agriculture, and the Suez 
        Canal being major contributors.</p>
