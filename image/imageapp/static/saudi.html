    <p>Saudi Arabia, officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, is the largest country in the Middle East, 
        occupying most of the Arabian Peninsula. Its rich history is rooted in ancient civilizations and 
        it is the birthplace of Islam, home to the religion's two holiest cities, Mecca and Medina. The 
        country's economy is heavily dependent on its vast oil reserves, making it the world's 
        second-largest oil producer and a major player in the global energy market. In recent years, 
        it has embarked on an ambitious plan, Vision 2030, to diversify its economy and society.</p>
